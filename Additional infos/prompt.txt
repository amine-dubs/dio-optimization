Make a python program using DIO Optimisation algo (Dholes-Inspired) used for hyper-parameters optimisation of random forest and feature selection at the same time, testing it on Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset from scikit-learn.

I think it should be a loop of first using the algo for feature selection then inside using it for parameters tunings on that selected features dataset or something like that.

Search for the dio original implementation and import it here, if there's only matlab implementation make it in python.

for feature selection:
n_features entries [0,1] thresholded at 0.5 â†’ selected/not selected.
Fitness: 0.99 * ( 1 - acc) + 0.01 * (n_selected / n_features)

You identify the ranges of the hyper-parameters...etc
