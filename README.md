# Dholes-Inspired Optimization (DIO) for Feature Selection and Hyperparameter Tuning

This project implements the **Dholes-Inspired Optimization (DIO)** algorithm for simultaneous feature selection and hyperparameter optimization of Random Forest classifiers, tested on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset.

## 🎯 Project Overview

The DIO algorithm is a nature-inspired metaheuristic optimization algorithm based on the cooperative hunting behavior of dholes (Asiatic wild dogs). This implementation uses DIO for:

1. **Feature Selection**: Identifying the most informative features from the dataset
2. **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Finding optimal Random Forest hyperparameters
3. **Nested Optimization**: Combining both tasks where hyperparameter optimization is the outer loop and feature selection is the inner loop

## 🏆 Key Results

### ✅ Benchmark Validation (Full Paper Settings)

**DIO implementation validated with 6.3M evaluations on 14 standard benchmark functions:**

|------------|--------|--------|
| Near-zero convergence (F1 Sphere) | 7.60e-26 | ✅ Excellent |
| Near-zero convergence (F10 Ackley) | 2.90e-12 | ✅ Matches Paper! |
| Global optimum found (F6, F11) | 0.0 | ✅ Perfect |
| Overall success rate | 86% (12/14) | ✅ Validated |
| Statistical significance | 30 runs per function | ✅ Publication-ready |

**See `BENCHMARK_RESULTS.md` for detailed analysis**

### 📊 Statistical Validation (30-Run Cross-Validation)

**Primary Achievement: Feature Selection**

| Metric | Result | Significance |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| **Mean Accuracy** | **94.72% ± 1.41%** | Robust across 30 splits |
| **Feature Reduction** | **73% (30 → 8 features)** | ✅ Major contribution |
| **vs. SVM** | +3.16% improvement | p < 0.001 ✓✓✓ |
| **vs. KNN** | +1.70% improvement | p < 0.001 ✓✓✓ |
| **vs. RF Default (Selected)** | -0.17% | p = 0.165 (not significant) |

### ⚠️ Critical Finding: Optimization Overfitting

**Single-Split Optimization (random_state=42):**
- ✅ Achieved 100% accuracy on that specific train/test split
- ✅ Identified 8 powerful features that generalize well

**30-Split Validation (random_state 42-71):**
- ⚠️ DIO-optimized hyperparameters: 94.72% ± 1.41%
- ⚠️ RF default hyperparameters (same 8 features): 94.89% ± 1.43%
- ⚠️ Difference: Not statistically significant (p = 0.165)

**Key Insight:** Hyperparameters optimized for a single data partition don't generalize as well as carefully tuned defaults. However, the **feature selection** (30→8) was highly effective and robust across all splits.

### 🎯 True Contributions

1. **✅ Feature Selection (Primary)**: 73% reduction with minimal accuracy loss
2. **✅ Pareto Optimality**: Best accuracy-complexity trade-off (94.72% with only 8 features)
3. **⚠️ Hyperparameter Tuning (Marginal)**: Defaults performed slightly better due to single-split overfitting

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/dio-optimization.git
cd dio-optimization
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

#### 1. Quick Demo: Single-Run Optimization (random_state=42)

```bash
python main.py
```

This will:
1. Load the Breast Cancer dataset from scikit-learn
2. Run nested DIO optimization (hyperparameter → feature selection)
3. Achieve 100% accuracy on the specific train/test split
4. Compare DIO-optimized Random Forest with baseline models
5. Generate visualizations and save results to `1_run_comparaison/`

**⚠️ Important:** This demonstrates optimization capability but hyperparameters may not generalize to other data splits (see "Optimization Overfitting" below).

**Execution Time:** ~30-60 seconds

#### 2. Statistical Validation: 30 Independent Runs

```bash
python statistical_comparison.py
```

This will:
1. Evaluate DIO-optimized configuration across 30 different train/test splits (random_state 42-71)
2. Compare with 9 baseline models on identical splits
3. Perform Wilcoxon signed-rank tests for statistical significance
4. Generate comprehensive results and visualizations in `30_runs_comparaison/`

**Key Insight:** This reveals that feature selection generalizes well (94.72% across all splits), but hyperparameter tuning showed minimal benefit over defaults (p=0.165).

**Execution Time:** ~2-3 minutes

#### 3. Algorithm Validation: Benchmark Testing

```bash
python run_benchmarks.py
```

This will:
1. Test DIO on 14 standard benchmark functions (F1-F14)
2. Run 30 independent trials per function (full paper configuration)
3. Generate performance comparison charts
4. Save results to `benchmark_results/`

**Execution Time:** ~60 minutes (6.3M function evaluations)

## 🧠 Algorithm Details

### DIO Algorithm

The Dholes-Inspired Optimization algorithm simulates the hunting strategies of dhole packs:

1. **Chasing (Exploitation)**: Dholes move toward the best solution (alpha dhole)
2. **Scouting (Exploration)**: Dholes explore new areas by following random pack members
3. **Pack Cooperation**: Dholes adjust positions based on the pack center

### Nested Optimization Structure

```
Outer Loop: Hyperparameter Optimization
├── For each hyperparameter set:
│   └── Inner Loop: Feature Selection
│       ├── Test different feature combinations
│       └── Return best feature subset
└── Select hyperparameters with best feature selection fitness
```

### Fitness Functions

**Feature Selection Fitness**:
```
fitness = 0.99 * (1 - accuracy) + 0.01 * (n_selected / n_total)
```
- Balances accuracy maximization with feature minimization
- 99% weight on accuracy, 1% weight on feature count

**Hyperparameter Fitness**:
- The fitness of a hyperparameter set is determined by the best feature selection fitness achieved with those parameters

## 🔧 Customization

### Adjusting DIO Parameters

In `main.py`, you can modify:

```python
# Hyperparameter optimization (outer loop)
hp_dio = DIO(
    objective_function=hyperparameter_objective_function,
    search_space=hp_search_space,
    n_dholes=5,          # Number of candidate solutions
    max_iterations=10    # Number of optimization iterations
)

# Feature selection (inner loop)
fs_dio = DIO(
    objective_function=feature_selection_objective_function,
    search_space=fs_search_space,
    n_dholes=10,         # Number of candidate solutions
    max_iterations=20    # Number of optimization iterations
)
```

### Hyperparameter Search Space

Modify the search ranges in `main.py`:

```python
hp_search_space = [
    [10, 200],    # n_estimators
    [1, 20],      # max_depth (1 = None)
    [2, 10],      # min_samples_split
    [1, 10]       # min_samples_leaf
]
```

## ⚠️ Important Methodological Insight: Optimization Overfitting

### The Phenomenon

During single-run optimization (`main.py`), DIO achieved **100% accuracy** on the test set with `random_state=42`. However, when these same hyperparameters were evaluated across 30 different data splits (`statistical_comparison.py`), performance averaged **94.72%**—slightly **worse** than Random Forest defaults (94.89%) using the same 8 features.

### Why This Happened

**Optimization overfitting:** Hyperparameters were tuned to excel on one specific train/test partition, not to generalize across multiple partitions. This is analogous to model overfitting, but at the meta-level—the optimization process itself overfit to the validation data.

### What This Means

1. ✅ **Feature selection was highly effective** (30→8 features, 73% reduction)
2. ✅ **Selected features generalized well** across all 30 different data splits
3. ⚠️ **Hyperparameter tuning provided minimal benefit** over scikit-learn defaults
4. ⚠️ **Single-split optimization is insufficient** for finding generalizable hyperparameters

### Recommended Approach

For production use, employ **k-fold cross-validation within the DIO optimization loop**:

```python
def fitness_function(hyperparameters, features):
    # Instead of single train/test split:
    scores = []
    for fold in range(k):  # e.g., k=5
        X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = get_fold(fold)
        model = RandomForest(**hyperparameters)
        model.fit(X_train[:, features], y_train)
        scores.append(model.score(X_test[:, features], y_test))
    
    avg_score = np.mean(scores)  # Use average across folds
    return fitness(avg_score, num_features)
```

This increases computational cost by a factor of k but yields hyperparameters that generalize across data partitions.

### Scientific Value

This finding is **not a failure**—it's an honest scientific result demonstrating:
- What works: Feature selection via metaheuristic optimization
- What doesn't: Single-split hyperparameter tuning
- Why it matters: Importance of proper validation methodology
- How to improve: Use cross-validation during optimization, not just evaluation
