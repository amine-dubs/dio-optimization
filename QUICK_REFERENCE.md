## ⚙️ Adjust Speed vs Quality

### Make it FASTER ⚡
Edit these lines in **main.py**:
```python
# Line 95-100 (inner loop)
n_dholes=3          # was 5
max_iterations=5    # was 10

# Line 124-129 (outer loop)
n_dholes=2          # was 3
max_iterations=3    # was 5
```

Edit **run_benchmarks.py** line 25:
```python
'n_dholes': 5,           # was 10
'max_iterations': 50,    # was 100
'num_runs': 3            # was 5
```

### Make it MORE ACCURATE 📈
Edit **main.py**:
```python
# Line 95-100 (inner loop)
n_dholes=10         # was 5
max_iterations=20   # was 10

# Line 124-129 (outer loop)
n_dholes=5          # was 3
max_iterations=10   # was 5
```

Edit **run_benchmarks.py** line 25:
```python
'n_dholes': 20,          # was 10
'max_iterations': 300,   # was 100
'num_runs': 10           # was 5
```
