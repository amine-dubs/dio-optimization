### **Middle** (Keep them engaged)
- Point to specific numbers in tables
- Use hand gestures for "three strategies"
- Pause after slide 13 (key findings)
- Emphasize "Pareto-optimal" multiple times

### **Closing** (End strong)
> "This demonstrates that with the right optimization, we can build medical AI that's both accurate AND efficient—critical for real-world deployment. Thank you."

### **Q&A** (Stay confident)
- Take a breath before answering
- "Great question about..."
- Acknowledge limitations honestly
- "That's exactly what we're exploring in future work"
